Client application, web app or mobile, records wallet registrations and relationships.

On demand or on a schedule it submits a request for levelling, providing all the
wallet details.

A REST webservice responds to the request with a list of transfers which would bring
the wallets into balance.

The client provides the transfers to the bitcoin client to be executed - details of
this interaction require investigation.

With appropriate credentials a service could automatically initiate the transfers.
